                Greetings! I'm a dedicated Full-Stack Web & Mobile Developer with a strong passion for creating cutting-edge applications. 
                I proudly completed a 6-month React Native internship, where I collaborated with a talented team to develop intuitive mobile apps. 
                After the internship, I promoted to a full-time role, from past 3 months i am working as a full time react-native developer.
